			<p>The Ph.D. program has two main tracks in the first year: Algebra and Applied
			and Computational Mathematics (ACM). You'll be asked to choose one based on your
			interests. For some people (discrete math) the choice may not be so clear. In this
			situation it is probably a good idea to contact a professor you may study with in 
			the future and ask them which track they recommend. </p>

				<p>Paying Tuition:</p>
				<p>1. Don't pay if its not right. </p>
				<p>2. If you have a stipend, normally you will only be paying for
				health insurance and technology fees ~$1000. Unfortunately, the exact
				amount changes every semester so its difficult to judge if its correct
				simply by the amount. </p>
				<p>3. Even if you are dropped from all your classes for nonpayment, you
				can be added back into all your classes if you speak with the grad
				director or the graduate secretary. </p> 
				
				<br>		
				<p><strong>TA Workload:</strong></p>
				<p>It's department policy that professors grade their exams not teaching assistants. However,
				if your professor chooses to ignore this rule, there is little you can do besides speaking with
				the graduate director. </p>
				<p>Your TA duties should average out to around 20 hours per week. If you find you're spending
				more than this amount of time, discuss the issue with your professor or the graduate director.</p>

				<p><strong>Getting Paid:</strong> Due to the complexity of the math department's 
				graduate student payroll, its has happened that students were not
				paid on time at the beginning of the semester. Depending on how 
				you feel about financial security, you may want to save enough at the
				 end of the semester so that you can go without a pay check in the 
				beginning of the semester.</p>

				<p>Q: What are the qualification exams?</p>
				<p>A: Two all-day exams: One on Analysis, One on Algebra or Computational Mathematics.
				They are usually given a week before school starts in the fall.</p>
				<p>Usually the first year knocks out about half the class. </p>
				<p>After you pass this exam you will receive a (very) small raise in your stipend. </p>
				<br>
				<p>You can find qualification exams from previous years on the math department website. Also
				many offices contain binders of old exams along with student solutions to the problems. Ask 
				around, and look for dusty binders.</p>   
				<br>
				<p>Q: What are the comprehensive exams?</p>
				<p>A: Three all-day exams, plus a 1~3 hour oral exam.</p>
				<p>While rare, people have failed these exams. It is better to approach them
				seriously, rather than as a formality. </p>  
				<p>After you pass this exam you will receive a (very) small raise in your stipend. </p>

				<p>Supplies for classes, such as markers, chalk, and erasers are available in the math office.</p>

				<p>When teaching Maple Lab, computers tend to boot up very slowly the first time you log into
					specific machine. This is also true for your students. </p> 
				<br>
				<p>The graduate student copier breaks down or is missing paper often. Therefore the safest time
				for important copies is when the main office is open. After 5pm there will be no one to save you. </p> 
				<br>
				<p>For large numbers of copies (tests, quizzes) its is preffered that you print a single page 
				and use the copier. </p>  
				<br>
				<p>Not all classrooms have chalkboards. Not all classrooms have white boards. It is suggested that

      <h2>FAQ:</h2>
      <p><strong>Why is it called the Peer Excellence Award?</strong><br>
         It is an Award chosen by our Peers in recognition of Excellence. Also, no one 
	    has paid $100 to have the award named after themselves. <br><br>
	    <strong>When will the award be presented?</strong><br>
	    Monday, April 27th at 3:45pm in the Wyman Williams room during the Department 
	    Awards ceremony.
	    <br><br>
	    <strong>Do I have to be present to win?</strong><br>
	    Yes. If you are not present your name will be scratched out and replaced with the
	    name of the runner-up. <br><br>
	    <strong>How do I choose who to vote for?</strong><br>
	    Vote for the graduate student that is the most excellent. You get to define excellence.
	    For help, Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as "the quality of being excellent."
